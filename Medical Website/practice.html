    <span class="spanfirst">Welcome to Ayush Medicos, we seek to preserve, protect, promote and advance the consciousness-based philosophy, knowledge, science and practice of Ayurveda for the benefit of all beings. Ayurveda offers a rich and dynamic body of knowledge that provides
        comprehensive disease management and supports holistic wellness on a deep level. With its roots dating back over five thousand years to India, Ayurveda is distinct in that it focuses on harmonizing the unique constitution of an individual with
        the natural rhythms of our world. Utilizing nutrition, lifestyle, herbal medicines and time-tested therapies, Ayurveda brings the elements back into balance within the body to create total wellness.
